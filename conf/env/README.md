# Local Env Files (Ignored)

This directory is a convenient place to keep local environment files used for development and ad-hoc testing.

Important:
- Files ending in `.env` are ignored by git via the root `.gitignore`.
- Do not commit secrets. If you need shared configuration, add a sanitized `*.env.example` file (no tokens/keys).
